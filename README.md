# Gear of the Dark

An overview website built in React for the podcast [Gear of the Dark](https://gearofthedark.podigee.io/), including a native audio player for listening and an archive with rudimentary sorting and search.

This project was initially my final project for a [React](https://react.dev) course at [CimData](https://www.cimdata.de/weiterbildung/programmieren-mit-javascript-framework-react/) done in about 4 days. The boilerplate behind it was provided, though I'll change and adjust the project incrementally to my liking as I work on it.
